# About This Site

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This isn't just a static website—it's a fully interactive **operating system experience** inspired by macOS, built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Zustand](https://zustand-demon.pmnd.rs/), and [UnoCSS](https://uno.antfu.me/).

### 🤖 Meet My AI Clone
At the heart of this portfolio is an **intelligent AI Avatar** that looks and speaks just like me!

- **Voice Cloning**: Powered by **[Speechify](https://speechify.com/)**, the AI uses a clone of my actual voice to communicate.
- **Interactive**: You can speak directly to the avatar, and it will respond with real-time subtitles.
- **Smart Tech**: The avatar is driven by advanced AI logic. You can explore the codebase by opening the **VS Code** app located in the bottom dock.

Explore the dock, open apps, and chat with my digital twin to learn more about what I do!
